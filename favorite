favorite movie 
My Favotite Tv show is game of thrones. I used to watch this show very excited and happily. Unfortunately the show ended badly so many people were not happy about the end scene. 
Game of Thrones is roughly based on the storylines of the A Song of Ice and Fire book series by George R. R. Martin, set in the fictional Seven Kingdoms of Westeros and the continent of Essos. 
The series follows several simultaneous plot lines.
